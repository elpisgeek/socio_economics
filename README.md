# Socio Economic Data Analysis and Visualization

In this repository,are the resources of my socio-economic data analysis and visualization project.These resources include;
* a data folder that contains csv data files used in the analysis.All the data files used were downloaded from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org) open data site.
* a python script named 'app.py' that makes up a multi-page interactive reporting engine (dashboard) that renders the visualizations of the data.
* a 'requirements.txt' file that contains the modules imported in the python script and thier respective versions,alongside a 'procfile' file that are needed for the application's deployment to a server.
* a 'README.md' file that contains the project and the repository information.

## About the Project

In this project,I intend to analyze and visualize in a multi-page reporting engine (dashboard), the data for three important socio-economic indicators.These indicators are Health,Education,and Economic growth.A greater part of the success of every country depends on the state of these three socio-economic indicators and the variables associated with them as they form an integral part of the country.

#### Health

Better health is central to human happiness and well-being.It also makes an important contribution to economic progress,as healthy populations live longer,are more productive,and save more.Many factors influence health status and a country's ability to provide quality health services for it's people.In this project,we visualize the historical data for variables or indicators associated with health to see the patterns of such indicators or variables over these years.Some of the indicators or variables associated with Health are;
* Life expectancy at birth
* Government expenditure on health (% of GDP)
* Mortality rate (Infants and Adult)
* and many more

#### Education

Education is a powerful driver of development and one of the strongest instruments for reducing poverty and improving
health,gender equality,peace,and stability.Developing countries have made tremendous progress in getting children into the class room and the majority of children worldwide are now in primary school.Many indicators or variables associated with education are considered in this analytics project which can be viewed in the reporting dashboard and examples are;
* School enrollment,% gross (primary,secondary,and tertiary)
* Government expenditure on education (% of GDP)
* Percentage of pupils teachers
* and many more 
 
#### Economic growth

The economy is an area of the production,distribution and trade,as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents.The economy forms an integral part of every country's development in the world.Some of the economic indicators considered in this analysis are;
* GDP per capita (% annual growth)
* Gross National Income
* GDP current
* and many more
